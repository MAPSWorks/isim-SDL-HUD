isim is a simple, vector-graphics based flight simulator-like application.

Its purpose is to make practicing instrument flying procedures easier, without the overhead of a full flight simulator.

The graphics and flight model are deliberately heavily simplified, to make it easier for the user to focus entirely on flying procedures.

It's still relatively incomplete, but it is runnable and everything that is present works as expected.
